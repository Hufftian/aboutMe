<summary><strong>🎨 Introduction: </strong></summary>

I relate to this theme because I’ve always felt like my personality exists in contrast.  
Sometimes I crave my own quiet time, and other times I’m at my best around loud, spontaneous idiots (my friends).

This page reflects that duality — mixing structure with creativity, coding with storytelling, and precision with curiosity.

We often think opposites clash, but I believe they **complement**.  
Whether it’s logic and emotion, work and play, or order and chaos — I try to bring both into everything I do.

<summary><strong>👤 About Me</strong></summary>

I’d love to ramble about myself forever, but I’ll keep it short — I know the DEVSOC gods have many candidates to bless (or roast).

Name’s Krish. I recently hit the big 1-9 (UNSW status: still pending legendary rank).  
I’m currently majoring in Computer Science, which means I spend my days wrestling with bugs and pretending I understand recursion.

Now, I live in contradiction — and that’s where the “opposites attract” theme felt just right.

I’m the guy who can game all night with the boys 🎮, but also get weirdly philosophical at 3AM. I chase that deadline adrenaline, even though deep down, I know it’s time to break up with procrastination. (We had a good run.)

Trying something new is kinda my thing — whether it's a tech stack, a hobby, or an oddly specific YouTube rabbit hole.

In short, I’m a walking contradiction. And honestly? I think that’s fun.
